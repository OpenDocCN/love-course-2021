- answers: '-   The traditional requirement of "virtuous and gentle" for women in
    marriage advertisements has evolved over time. In the past, it was a common expectation
    for women to be described as "virtuous and gentle" in marriage advertisements.
    However, this expectation has gradually diminished, especially in more recent
    years and particularly in advertisements targeting educated and affluent individuals.

    -   Several factors contribute to the diminishing frequency of the term "virtuous
    and gentle" in marriage advertisements, especially in those targeting educated
    and affluent individuals. One factor is the changing perceptions of gender roles
    and expectations. As societal norms evolve to embrace more egalitarian views on
    relationships, there is less emphasis on traditional gender roles, including the
    expectation for women to be "virtuous and gentle." Additionally, as women gain
    more education and economic independence, they may prioritize qualities in a partner
    beyond traditional notions of virtue and gentleness.

    -   In contemporary marriage advertisements, modern women are increasingly seeking
    partners who are willing and able to care for them. Rather than focusing solely
    on traditional notions of "virtuous and gentle," modern women may prioritize qualities
    such as empathy, emotional intelligence, and shared responsibilities in a relationship.
    This shift reflects changing societal attitudes towards gender roles and expectations,
    with a greater emphasis on equality and mutual support in partnerships.

    -   Societal changes, such as shifts in gender roles and expectations, significantly
    influence the language and criteria used in marriage advertisements. As attitudes
    towards gender roles evolve, so too do the expectations placed on individuals
    seeking partners. Marriage advertisements reflect these changes by emphasizing
    qualities that align with contemporary views on relationships and partnerships,
    such as mutual respect, communication, and shared goals.

    -   There may be notable differences in the portrayal of gender roles and expectations
    in marriage advertisements across different cultural or socioeconomic contexts.
    In more traditional or conservative societies, marriage advertisements may still
    emphasize traditional gender roles and expectations, including the expectation
    for women to be "virtuous and gentle." In contrast, in more progressive or egalitarian
    societies, marriage advertisements are likely to reflect changing attitudes towards
    gender roles, with less emphasis on traditional expectations and a greater focus
    on equality and partnership. Similarly, in different socioeconomic contexts, the
    criteria used in marriage advertisements may vary based on factors such as education,
    income, and social status.'

  summary: "-   从征婚启事上逐渐消失的一个词汇——“贤惠”\n    1.  过去征婚启事常要求女性“贤惠”，但现在这一要求逐渐消失\n    2.\
    \  在高学历小资征婚中，“贤惠”一词被提及的频率更少\n    3.  现代女性更倾向于寻找“愿意照顾她”的男性，而不再强调“贤惠”"
  text: '# 从征婚启事上逐渐消失的一个词汇——“贤惠”> 原文：<https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/64080421>我之前说过，我从儿童时期就开始琢磨征婚启事，很清楚很多很多年前的征婚启事是怎么写的。我也多次提到过去的女方的征婚启事经常要求男性“忠厚老实”，而今天已经不这么要求了。下面，我要谈另一个几乎消失的择偶条件——贤惠。很早期，男方要求女方“贤惠”（一般是“温柔贤惠”四个字一起用）简直是征婚启事标配。而且当时的老人劝说儿子结婚，也确实会说”你该找一个女人照顾你了“。随着时代的变迁，“贤惠”一词被提到的频率越来越少，尤其是在高学历的小资征婚的时候不怎么提。——————————————————如果问没有结婚的男青年，（在女友其他条件不变的大前提下）女友的贤惠程度增加，他乐意么？我估计大部分男青年是乐意的。但是，“贤惠”被视为要求女方过多隐忍、付出，有一种“反动词汇”的味道，哪个男人提就有“直男癌”的嫌疑，识趣的男性就不提了。女性则不然，公然声称择偶条件是“愿意照顾我、能照顾我”的女性比比皆是，这个择偶要求的实质就是希望男方是一个”贤惠“男友或丈夫。————————————————————不仅仅如此，过去的女性家长虽然也会索取彩礼，但至少会唠叨几句“女孩子要贤惠”。现在，彩礼随着祖国的经济发展一起发展，对女儿唠叨“女人要贤惠”的家庭的比例却下降了。中国的新一代男士不争气呀，节节败退！'
